## connectFour
  A simple game of connect four

### Usage
  - After cloning the repo run ```npm install``` from the root folder
  - next run ```npm start```
  - then navigate to ```localhost:3000```, unless you have added a ```PORT``` variable to your environment then you would want to go to ```localhost:'your PORT'```
  - have fun playing connect four with a friend or by yourself!

### Notes
  - I spent ~ 4 hours on this
  - I used jquery because of the size of the project and the amount of time given to complete
